# Eye-Ease
Eye Ease is a Chrome extension designed to remind users to take regular breaks and reduce eye strain during long hours of computer use. It provides gentle reminders to look away from the screen every 20 minutes and focus on a distant object for 20 seconds, following the 20-20-20 rule recommended by optometrists.

## Features 
- Regular Break Reminders: Eye Ease reminds users to take a break every 20 minutes to look at something 20 meters away for 20 seconds.
- Customizable: Users can adjust break intervals and notification settings according to their preferences.
- Non-Intrusive Popup: Displays a gentle popup window to remind users without interrupting their workflow.
- Idle Detection: Opens a popup window if the user is idle, ensuring they never miss a break even when away from the computer.
- Sleek Design: Clean and minimalist interface seamlessly integrates into the browsing experience.

## Usage
Once installed, Eye Ease will automatically remind you to take breaks at regular intervals. You can customize the break intervals and notification settings by clicking on the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar.
